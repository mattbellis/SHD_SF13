This is an example of how one could read in a text file consisting of irregular 
data structures. 

The data is stored in an ASCII text file and represnts mock census information
on 1000 families. For each family, we store information about the 

parents:
    # of parents
    For each parent:
        sex
        gender identity
        age
        weight (kilograms)
        height (meters) 
 
children:
    # of children
    For each child:
        sex
        gender identity
        age
        weight (kilograms)
        height (meters) 

pets:
    # of pets
    For each pet:
        type of animal
        age
 
Other family information:
    household income
    latitude (of home)
    longitude (of home)


In this directory, you will find a file (Python) with helper utiltiies to 
parse this sample data file called

    family_utilities.py

An an example of how to use these utilities is provided as

    read_data.py

To run this, simply do

    python read_data.py example_families_dataset.dat

This will loop over all the families and dump to the screen the
number of parents and their information and the number of 
children and their information.
